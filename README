############# SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT ###############

I've run this on a mac - specific instructions are mac related

# install rbenv (ruby version manager)
brew update
brew install rbenv
# set up rbenv in the shell - gives instructions about line to put in .profile
rbenv init

cd /to/your/clone

# clone the git repo
git clone XXXXXX

# install specific verision of ruby using rbenv (.ruby-version file determines this)
rbenv install
# 
# install bundler gem for your specific ruby version

## BUGS ##

* might not deal well with all audit log formats, contents. String parsing can be improved upon.
* needs more detection for failures here ^^^^
